# Module 3 Project: Pretraining Data Pipeline & Voice Agent Development

## 🚀 Quick Summary
Built a **two-part project**:  
1. A **pretraining data pipeline** that scrapes scientific papers, extracts text via OCR, and cleans/deduplicates data.  
2. A **real-time voice agent** supporting 5-turn multi-round conversations using ASR (Whisper), LLM (LLaMA 3), and TTS (CozyVoice).  
Deliverables include a **clean dataset** for LLM training and a **local FastAPI server** for interactive voice dialogue.  
Demonstrates skills in **data engineering, NLP preprocessing, multimodal pipelines, and conversational AI development**.

## 📖 Project Description
This project was designed to simulate **real-world AI workflows** in two areas:  

1. **Pretraining Data Pipeline** – Building a scalable, high-quality dataset for LLM pretraining, emphasizing **data quality, deduplication, and multi-source diversity**.  
2. **Voice Agent Development** – Creating a lightweight local voice assistant capable of **real-time dialogue**, integrating speech recognition, language modeling, and speech synthesis.  

The project highlights the importance of **data quality for model performance** and showcases the integration of multiple AI components into a single interactive system.

## 🎯 Objectives

### Pretraining Data Pipeline
- Scrape scientific papers from arXiv on selected topics (e.g., NLP, AI safety).  
- Extract text from PDFs using OCR tools (Tesseract, Surya, GPT-4o Vision API).  
- Clean and filter data:  
  - Deduplicate with MinHash  
  - Remove PII (emails, phone numbers, credit cards)  
  - Filter non-English and low-quality text  
- Produce a **clean, diverse dataset** simulating state-of-the-art LLM training data.  

### Voice Agent Development
- Build a FastAPI server for audio input/output.  
- Use **Whisper** for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).  
- Integrate **LLaMA 3** for dialogue generation with conversation state tracking.  
- Synthesize speech with **CozyVoice** for natural TTS output.  
- Support **5-turn multi-round conversations** with history preservation.

## 📂 Deliverables
- `clean_dataset/` → pretraining-ready text corpus (deduplicated, PII-free).  
- `scraper/` → arXiv scraping and cleaning scripts.  
- `ocr_pipeline/` → PDF-to-text OCR processing scripts.  
- `voice_agent/` → FastAPI-based real-time voice assistant code.  
- Example outputs:  
  - `stats.md` → dataset statistics (token counts, % removed).  
  - Conversation transcripts (JSON).
